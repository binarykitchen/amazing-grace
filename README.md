[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/binarykitchen/amazing-grace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/binarykitchen/amazing-grace)

A tiny middleware for a sweet graceful shutdown procedure. Just listen to amazing Grace while closing the app. Existing connections will be respected during a configurable period of time.

This middleware is recommended if you want to harden your nodejs app for zero down time during produciton.
